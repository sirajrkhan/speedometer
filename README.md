speedometer
===========

Speedometer based on JavaScript and CSS3. This was a PoC done for Samsung Galaxy Gear wearable device.

This was developed using Tizen IDE for Wearable; the device browser officially jQuery 1.8 but practially did not work even with jQuery 1.7-- few take-away(s) from this exercise:

•	It didn’t support: 
o	some extended Jquery modules (first i searched before developing it :p )
o	dynamically attaching classes to CSS properties using JavaScript
o	Few CSS properties for animation 
o	Proper spacing between objects with “float” properties
